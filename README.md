# Berlin Cyclist Accidents Analysis - mid-term project

## Description

This project aims to analyze the relationship between population density, geographical location, and the number of cyclists involved in road accidents in Berlin.

## Hypotheses

1. In districts with higher population density, the number of cyclists involved in accidents on the roads is higher.
2. In districts that are near the city center, the number of cyclists involved in accidents on the roads is higher.

## Datasets Used

- Berlin road accident data - https://daten.berlin.de/datensaetze/stra%C3%9Fenverkehrsunf%C3%A4lle-nach-unfallort-berlin-2021
- Berlin population data - https://www.statistik-berlin-brandenburg.de/a-i-16-hj
- Berlin geographical data - https://daten.odis-berlin.de/

### Final Documents

1. `main.ipynb`  
    - Main notebook that consolidates all work and analyses.

2. `project_functions.py`  
    - Python script containing utility functions and libraries used in the project.
